1. add ecp5.lpf from ECP5 folder for contstraint file instead of icebox.pcf
	-make sure pin names match i/o of pulse_gen (I had to change P2 to Block)
2. to create ecp pll file (with 12 MHz input), run the command: ecppll -i 12 -o 200 --clkin_name clock_in --clkout0_name clock_out -f ecppll.v
	-optional: delete icepll.v (shouldn't cause any confusion since it's not included in Makefile, but doesn't hurt)
3. replace HX8K Makefile with Makefile from ECP5 folder to use that toolchain
4. make sure clk_constraint.py uses correct frequency values (12 input, 200 output)
After performing these steps and running make, output reports that timing fails (max freq ~187 MHz). Made following changes to improve timing:
